    <p> <strong> 1945 </strong> Vannevar Bush writes As We May Think. In this paper he described a theoretical storage and retrieval device, called a memex — which would use a system remarkably similar to what we now call hypertext. "The machine was to extend
      the powers of human memory and association. Just as the human mind forms memories through associations, the user of the memex would be able to make links between documents." </p>

<strong> 1957 </strong> Soviet Union launches Sputnik I, the first artificial satellite

<strong> 1958 </strong> President Eisenhower reacts by forming two government agencies to advance space technologies, weapons, and communication systems: Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

<strong> 1962 </strong> ARPA forms the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), which conducts research on command and control systems. JCR Licklider, a psychologist, becomes IPTO's first director. He emphasizes time-sharing systems, graphical
computing, point-and -click interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce, online banking, and software that would exist on a network and migrate to wherever it was needed. He believed that computers could be used to augment human thinking and suggested that
an ARPA computer network be established to allow researchers to communicate information with each other efficiently. Man computer symbiosis would augment human intellect by freeing it from mundane tasks.

<strong> 1964 </strong> Paul Baran at RAND develops packet-switching networks ("Unmanned nodes would act as switches routing packets from one node to another to their final destinations") and produces several papers on distributed networks. The design
of ARPANET relied heavily on Baran's work.

<strong> 1965 </strong> Ted Nelson coins the term hypertext, to describe a system for non-linear linking of documents — directly inspired by the work of Vannevar Bush. Doug Engelbart, also working in the 1960s (his active life as a thinker and inventor
in computing extends from the 50s to this day), envisioned computers augmenting the human intellect (like Bush and Licklider), allowing people to work in an "information space where they could formulate and organise their ideas with incredible speed and
flexibility". His oNLine System (NLS) paved the way for digital libraries, the use of hypertext documents and video teleconferencing. And he invented the mouse. His 90 minute, 1968 demo is a landmark in computing.

<strong> 1967 </strong> Larry Roberts at MIT establishes the first ARPANET plan. His idea is to connect all of the time-sharing computers to one another directly, over dial-up telephone lines. He draws upon Baran's ideas.

<strong> 1968 </strong> Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BNN) are awarded a million-dollar contract to build Interface Message Processors (IMPs) — routers.

<strong> 1969 </strong> The first ARPANET connections are made. * Node 1: UCLA (September) * Node 2: Stanford Research Institute (SRI) (October) * Node 3: University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) (November) * Node 4: University of Utah (December)

<strong> 1973 </strong> ARPA changes its name to DARPA, adding "D" for "Defense"

<strong> 1974 </strong> Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn publish "A Protocolfor Packet Network Intercommunication" which specifies the architecture of a Transmission Control Program (TCP).This allowed otherwise incompatible computers to communicate with each other
via the IMPs (routers). Bob Metcalfe works on Ethernet technology: Ethernet local area networks connect computers within an organisation to one, shared internet connection, so the invention of the Ethernet is important in enabling the spread of access
to the internet.

<strong> 1978 </strong> TCP split into TCP and IP. TCP or Transmission Control Protocol is designated as the host-to-host protocol and an IP, or internwork, protocol, would pass individual packets between machines. The pair become collectively known as
TCP/IP.

<strong> 1982 </strong> TCP/IP established as a standard

<strong> 1991 </strong> World-Wide Web (WWW) is released by CERN in Geneva. Working during the 80s and the 90s, Tim Berners-Lee creates HyperText Markup Language (HTML), which use specifications for URLs or Uniform Resource Locators, for web addresses.
Berners-Lee's vision of "a global information space where information stored on computers everywhere was linked and available to anyone anywhere'. He combined hypertext and the internet: "Hypertext would allow any document in the information space to
be linked to any other document. The Internet would allow those documents to be transmitted. ... The new system would need to be easy and decentralized so that anyone anywhere could share information without having to go to a centralized authority." In
1989, Berners-Lee submitted a proposal at CERN to develop an information system that would create a web of information. Initially, his proposal received no reply, but he began working on his idea anyway. In 1990, he wrote the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP)—the language computers would use to communicate hypertext documents over the Internet and designed a scheme to give documents addresses on the Internet. Berners-Lee called this address a Universal Resource Identifier (URI). (This is now usually
known as a URL—Uniform Resource Locator.) By the end of the year he had also written a client program (browser) to retrieve and view hypertext documents. He called this client "WorldWideWeb." Hypertext pages were formatted using the Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML) that Berners-Lee had written. He also wrote the first web server. A web server is the software that stores web pages on a computer and makes them available to be accessed by others. Berners-Lee set up the first web server known as "info.cern.ch."
at CERN. Berners-Lee tried to sell his new creation at CERN as a way to link data between the many incompatible systems at CERN. Still the bureaucracy at CERN was slow in acknowledging his efforts. Berners-Lee then turned to the Internet community. In
1991, he made his WorldWideWeb browser and web server software available on the Internet and posted notices to several newsgroups including alt.hypertext. The Web began to take off as computer enthusiasts around the world began setting up their own web
servers. Often the owners of the new sites would email Berners-Lee and he would link to their sites from the CERN site. His dream of a global information space was finally happening. As the number of users on the Web grew it became more attractive as
a medium. Scientists, who were already used to sharing information on the Internet began to embrace the Web. It was easier to post information on the Web once than reply repeatedly to multiple requests for the same data. They also no longer had to worry
whether or not the other scientists used a different operating system. Government agencies who had responsibilities to make their information public also began turning toward the Web. As more people began using the Web the need for more point-and-click
browsers became evident. Berners-Lee had developed his WorldWideWeb browser on a very specialized personal computer called a NeXT. What was needed now was browser that Mac, PC, and Unix users could use. This need was soon met as others, mostly students,
began creating new browsers.

<strong> 1993 </strong> Mosaic, which is one of the first Internet browsers is released by Marc Andreesen and proliferates the web with a 341,634% annual growth rate of service traffic. Mosaic provides a graphical interface to search the Internet, thus
making the Internet more visually appealing.
